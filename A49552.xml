            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Nor is it at all likely, that in ſo ſhort a ſpace as the Reign of Seven Kings, they ſhould quite forgoe the Language and Cuſtomes of their Anceſtors, though the <hi>Britans</hi> might well undergo a great alteration in both, for ſo long it was ere the <hi>Romans</hi> knew them. As for the Altar erected in <hi>Caledonia</hi> with an Inſcription of Greek letters mentioned by <hi>Solinus,</hi> it may ſeem to be the work of ſome <hi>Grecian,</hi> that came with theſe <hi>Trojans</hi> from <hi>Chaonia,</hi> or ſome other <hi>Greek</hi> Travellers, in honour of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> as a great Navigator, by which means <hi>

I confeſs it does not appear to me an irrefragable Argument againſt the ſo long received Tradition of <hi>Brutus,</hi> that no <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtorian ſpeaks of him, ſince we find in them but a ſlender account of thoſe times wherein he muſt be ſuppoſed to have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and little more than the bare names of the <hi>Alban</hi> Kings which more directly appertained to them. And for thoſe who wrote after the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49786:7"/>entry of the <hi>Romans</hi> into <hi>Britain,</hi> much of their Writings is loſt, as of <hi>Tacitus, Suetonius, Dion Caſſius</hi> and others, which might have made ſomething for this purpoſe. Nor is there any great weight in the objection of ſome others, That the name of <hi>Brutus</hi> is not ſo ancient as the time of this Britiſh King; ſince <hi>Nennius</hi> calls him <hi>Brito,</hi> of which name <hi>Hyginus Polyhiſtor</hi> mentions a <hi>Centaure</hi> (or <hi>Theſſalian</hi>), and other <hi>Greek</hi> Writers ſpeak of a Nymph named <hi>Britona</hi> and <hi>Britomartis.</hi> But when the <hi>Romans</hi> came to be Lords of the World, the <hi>Britans</hi> ambitious to claim Kindred with them, and to ingratiate themſelves with them, might poſſibly vary the <hi>Greek</hi> name of this Prince into the Roman name of <hi>Brutus,</hi> differing little from it in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntiation. And ſeeing it is manifeſt that even the moſt unlearned and barbarous Nations have preſerved the memory of ſome of their old He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes, eſpecially of the Founders, without <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> Authors, why may we not allow our <hi>Britans</hi> their <hi>Brito</hi> or <hi>Brutus,</hi> though we do not admit the whole Bed-roll of Kings recited in the <hi>Monmouth</hi> Hiſtory?

            <p>Under the <hi>Romans Britain</hi> was at firſt accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Preſidial Province, and appropriate to the <hi>Caeſars,</hi> as being annexed to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire after the diviſion of Provinces ordained by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus,</hi> and had <hi>Propraetors</hi> of their own.

            <p>
               <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Gaule</hi> are ſaid to have made up one Kingdom anciently, of which <hi>Samothes,</hi> Sirnamed <hi>Dis pater,</hi> was the firſt King; after whom ſucceeded his Son <hi>Magus,</hi> then <hi>Sarron</hi> Son to <hi>Magus, Druis</hi> Son to <hi>Sarron, Bardus</hi> Son to <hi>Druis, Longo</hi> Son to <hi>Bardus, Bardus junior</hi> Son to <hi>Longo, Lucus</hi> Brother to <hi>Bardus, Celtes</hi> Son to <hi>Bardus;</hi> this King was Sirnamed <hi>Breta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus;</hi> and had a Daughter named <hi>Galatea,</hi> whom <hi>Hereules Lybicus</hi> married, and of her begat <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,</hi> (<hi>Parthenius Nicaeus</hi> calls the Mother <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,</hi> and the Son <hi>Celtes,</hi> after his Grandfather's name;) this <hi>Galates</hi> reigned after his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father and Mother: then followed <hi>Narbon</hi> Son to <hi>Galates, Lugdus</hi> Son to <hi>Narbon, Beligius</hi> Son to <hi>Lugdus,</hi> who dying without iſſue <hi>Jaſius</hi> King of <hi>Italy</hi> (Son of <hi>Camboblaſcon,</hi> who was great Grandſon to <hi>Thuſcus</hi> the Son of <hi>Hercules</hi>)
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49786:29"/>ſucceeded him; but he being murdered by his Brother <hi>Dardanus,</hi> had for his Succeſſor <hi>Allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brox,</hi> a nearer Kinſman to <hi>Beligius,</hi> put by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore poſſibly for being under age. Then follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Romus</hi> Son to <hi>Allobrox, Paris</hi> Son to <hi>Romus, Lemanes</hi> Son to <hi>Paris, Olbius</hi> Son to <hi>Lemanes, Galates junior</hi> Son to <hi>Olbius, Namnes</hi> Son to <hi>Galates,</hi> and <hi>Rhemus</hi> Son to <hi>Namnes.</hi> During the Reigns of theſe <hi>Samothean</hi> Kings hapned nothing remarkable, only that in the time of King <hi>Lucus, Oſiris</hi> the great King of <hi>Egypt</hi> was ſlain by his Brother <hi>Typhon,</hi> with the help of <hi>Laeſtrigon, Antaeus, Gerion, Albion</hi> and <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> the Grandſons of the murdered Heroe by his Son <hi>Neptune,</hi> after which <hi>Albion</hi> and <hi>Bergi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> with a multitude of <hi>Africans</hi> coming into <hi>Spain</hi> (where <hi>Gerion</hi> reigned) from thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded and conquered <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> where they ruled for ſome years. But in the time of <hi>Celtes, Hereules</hi> purſuing the revenge of his Father's death, kills <hi>Typhon</hi> and <hi>Antaeus,</hi> ſettles his Brother <hi>Orus</hi> and his mother <hi>Iſis</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Egypt,</hi> deſtroyes <hi>Gerion</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and marches into <hi>Gaule</hi> with intention to paſs into <hi>Italy. Celtes</hi> joyfully entertains him, in requital whereof he built the City of <hi>Alexia. Albion</hi> and <hi>Bergion</hi> ſuſpecting he would at length call them to an account, reſolved to be before hand with him, and came againſt him with a puiſſant Army, who, having married <hi>Galatea,</hi> and increaſed his Army with <hi>Gauliſh</hi> Supplies, encountred them in a place named <hi>The Stony Strond,</hi> or <hi>Stony Field,</hi> (now called by the <hi>French, Le Craux,</hi>) where after a long and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49786:29"/>terrible fight the two Brothers were deſeated and ſlain. From thence <hi>Hercules</hi> departed into <hi>Italy,</hi> where he ſlew <hi>Laeſtrygon.</hi> The <hi>Samotheans</hi> in <hi>Britain,</hi> emboldned by the ſucceſs of this Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, took up Arms againſt the reſidue of the <hi>Africans</hi> that were leſt behind, commencing a long war, which continued till the coming of <hi>Brutus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this interval the fifty Daughters of <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſian</hi> King of <hi>Syria,</hi> having all murdered their Husbands in one night, were for their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment embarqued in a Ship well victualled, but without Pilot, Maſt, or Sail, and ſo committed to the mercy of the Seas. At laſt they were caſt upon the Weſtern Coaſt of this Iſland, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by the <hi>African</hi> Progeny, to whom wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were very welcome, in regard the <hi>Samo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theans</hi> diſdained to give their Daughters to them. The Eldeſt of theſe, named <hi>Albina,</hi> was married to the Prince of theſe Barbarians, and renewed to this Iſle the name of <hi>Albion,</hi> which had been before impoſed by <hi>Neptune</hi>'s forementioned Son of that name, but now was worn out. This Fable I conceive to be foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the <hi>Grecian</hi> Story of <hi>Danaus</hi> his Daughters. King <hi>Remus</hi> having no other chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren but one Daughter, gave her in marriage to <hi>Franicus, Francus,</hi> or <hi>Francion,</hi> Son to <hi>Hector</hi> King of the <hi>Germans,</hi> whoſe Father <hi>Brennus</hi> was lineally deſcended from the ancient <hi>Tuiſco.</hi> He ſucceeded his Father and Father-in-Law, and kept his reſidence in a City of <hi>Pannonia</hi> which himſelf had built, and called <hi>Sicambria,</hi> after the name of his Son <hi>Sicamber,</hi> who
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49786:30"/>reigned after him, and married a Lady named <hi>Galatea,</hi> having firſt ſlain his Rival <hi>Acis</hi> a <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Prince. The <hi>Greeks</hi> for his valour called him <hi>Polyphemus,</hi> which ſignifies, <hi>famous;</hi> and the Poets fable him to be a <hi>Cyclopian</hi> Giant, and Son of <hi>Neptune,</hi> whom they generally make the Father of Gigantick Iſſues. This <hi>Polyphemus Sicamder</hi> is by the <hi>Germans</hi> named <hi>Woltheim Sichinger.</hi> At his death he divided his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom between his three Sons; to <hi>Celtes</hi> he left <hi>Germany,</hi> who extended the name of <hi>Celts</hi> to all the people of that Land; <hi>Gaule,</hi> and ſo much of <hi>Britain</hi> as was held by the <hi>Samotheans,</hi> fell to <hi>Galates;</hi> and <hi>Pannonia</hi> to <hi>Illyrius,</hi> who by Conqueſt added to it the Countrey which of him took the name of <hi>Illyris. Francus</hi> had par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled <hi>Gaule</hi> into twelve Provinces, and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted over each of them a Vice-roy, with orders to be aiding to his <hi>Samothean</hi> Subjects as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhould require: but Ambition prompted them to other Deſigns, whereunto they were animated by their Princes over-large Bounty, who (it ſeems) had made their Prefectures He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary; ſo that after the death of <hi>Galates,</hi> whoſe Reign was ſpent in Wars abroad, they aſſumed to themſelves the Royal Title and Power. In the Reign of <hi>Wolfheim Sichinger</hi> the famous City of <hi>Troy</hi> was taken by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> whereupon <hi>Aeneas</hi> and <hi>Antenor</hi> were forced to ſeek new ſeats, of whom the latter found means to ſettle himſelf about <hi>Padua,</hi> the other in <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> whoſe Son and Succeſſour <hi>Aſcanius</hi> built <hi>Alba Longa.</hi> But far worſe fortune had many of their Countreymen, who with their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49786:30"/>were carried away Captive into <hi>Greece</hi> by <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> and by him kept in ſlavery. From him deſcended one <hi>Pandraſus,</hi> as <hi>Geffrey</hi> calls him, though the <hi>Greeks</hi> had another name for him, who ſhewed himſelf very cruel to the iſſue of theſe <hi>Trojans.</hi> In his time a certain Nobleman dying left two Sons, the one by a <hi>Greek</hi> wife, the other (named <hi>Aſſaracus</hi>) by a <hi>Trojan,</hi> who falling out about the ſharing of their Father's Territory, cauſed the King to intereſt himſelf in the quarrel, who hating the <hi>Trojan</hi> Nation, and conſequently <hi>Aſſaracus</hi> for his relation to them, took his Brothers part againſt him, and would by force have diſſeiſed him of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, if he had not been opportunely ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour'd by <hi>Brutus,</hi> of whom we come now to ſpeak.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aſcanius</hi> King of <hi>Alba</hi> dying, there aroſe a controverſie about the ſucceſſion between his Son <hi>Julus,</hi> and his Half-Brother <hi>Sylivins Poſthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> the Son of <hi>Aeneas</hi> by <hi>Lavinia,</hi> the firſt being favoured by the <hi>Trojans,</hi> the other by the <hi>Latines,</hi> who being more numerous, advanced <hi>Poſthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> to the Crown, aſſigning the Pontificate to <hi>Julus,</hi> who upon the reconciliation aſſumed his Uncles name for his <hi>Praenomen,</hi> and was called <hi>Sylvius Julus.</hi> It was made a piea againſt him, that he was not of years ſufficient to manage the weighty affairs of a Kingdom; by which it appears that he married very young, having had two Sons before his Fathers death, from the Elder of whom the <hi>Julian</hi> Family deſcended. The Younger, named <hi>Brutus,</hi> proved fatal to both his Parents, for his Mother died in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49786:31"/>Child-bed, and at fifteen years of age he by miſchance killed his Father at a hunting, for which he was baniſhed by <hi>Poſthumus,</hi> and went into <hi>Greece,</hi> where upon ſundry occaſions he gave ſuch proofs of his valour, as encouraged the poor oppreſſed <hi>Trojans</hi> to repair to him, and requeſt him to undertake the freeing of them from the <hi>Grecian</hi> Bondage. <hi>Brutus</hi> becomes their Prince, and entring league with <hi>Aſſaracus</hi> wins two victories of <hi>Pandraſus.</hi> In the firſt, <hi>Antigonus</hi> the King's Brother, and his friend <hi>Anacletus</hi> were taken Priſoners; in the other, the King himſelf. Hereupon, by the means of a <hi>Trojan</hi> named <hi>Mempricius,</hi> enſued a peace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Aſſaracus</hi> was ſecured in his Right, and <hi>Brutus</hi> obtained in marriage the King's eldeſt Daughter <hi>Innogen,</hi> with a Fleet of three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred twenty four Ships, well provided with all neceſſaries to tranſport the <hi>Trojans</hi> and their Families to another Country. The firſt place he arrived at, was an Iſland where <hi>Diana</hi> had a Temple, whoſe Oracle he with his Soothſayer <hi>Gerion,</hi> conſults about the ſucceſs of his Voyage, and receives a propitious Anſwer. From hence departing, he ſailed along the coaſt of <hi>Africk,</hi> conquering by the way the Pirates of thoſe Seas, and for a freſh ſupply of proviſion was forced to land in <hi>Mauritania,</hi> and forrage the Countrey; then paſſing the Straits of <hi>Gibralter</hi> came, as <hi>Geffrey</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> ſaith, into the <hi>Tyrrhen</hi> Sea. It ſhould ſeem, the old <hi>Britiſh</hi> Writers meant not by that name the Sea of <hi>Etruria,</hi> for the Straits-mouth was out of the way from the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean</hi> thither; but they underſtood ſome
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49786:31"/>nearer Sea by it, as appears by <hi>Nennius,</hi> who tells us, that King <hi>Belinus</hi> the Son of <hi>Minocanus</hi> ſubdued the Iſles of the <hi>Tyrrhen</hi> Sea, whereas the <hi>Britans</hi> never uſed to ſail ſo far as <hi>

Here <hi>Brutus</hi> met with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fleet of <hi>Trojans,</hi> commanded by <hi>Chorinaeus,</hi> who was deſcended from <hi>Antenor;</hi> him he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints with the Anſwer he had from the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs, and prevails with him to joyn with him in his Deſign. Hence they paſs forward through the <hi>Gallick</hi> Sea, and caſt Anchors in the River <hi>Loire,</hi> which parted <hi>Aquitaine</hi> and <hi>Armorica. Gaule</hi> was at this time governed by twelve Princes, one of whom, named <hi>Groffarius,</hi> had <hi>Pictavia,</hi> and part of theſe two Provinces afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named for his ſhare, who hearing the arrival of theſe Strangers in his Dominions, ſent out a party to take an account of them. Theſe found <hi>Chorinaeus</hi> with two hundred men chaſing their Maſter's Deer, and after ſome angry Expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations fell to blows, where <hi>Imbert</hi> Commander of the <hi>Gaules</hi> was ſlain by <hi>Cherinaeus,</hi> and his men put to flight. <hi>Groffarius</hi> hereat incenſed, marches againſt the <hi>Trojans,</hi> who now were all landed, and ready for the Encounter, which was very ſharp; but at laſt the Victory fell to the new Comers, who waſting the Country at their pleaſure, loaded their Ships with ſpoil and pillage. In this Battel one <hi>Suardus,</hi> a great Nobleman of <hi>Gaul,</hi> loſt his life by the hand of <hi>Chorinaeus.</hi> But now the other Eleven Princes haſten to the ſuccour of their vanquiſhed friend,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49786:32"/>and overbearing the Strangers with multitude, beat them to their Camp, and there beſeige them. About midnight <hi>Chorinaeus</hi> gets out with three thouſand men, and lodges them in an adjoyning Wood till morning, at what time <hi>Brutus</hi> marched into the field, whom the <hi>Gauls</hi> moſt furiouſly aſſail with aſſured hopes of Conqueſt, when on a ſudden <hi>Chorinaeus</hi> from the Wood falls in deſperately upon their Rear, who ſeeing themſelves engaged both before and behind, and thinking theſe laſt had been a new ſupply brought by Sea, and more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber than they were, began to faint; which their Enemies perceiving redoubled their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, and charged them ſo fiercely, that they put them to a total rout. In this fight <hi>Turnus,</hi> the Nephew of <hi>Brutus.</hi> who came from <hi>Italy</hi> with <hi>Chorinaeus,</hi> was ſlain, after he had perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med incredible exploits, from whom the people of the countrey where the Battle was fought were named <hi>Turones.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brutus</hi> began now to conſider, the numbers of his men were ſhrewdly diminiſhed by theſe conflicts, whereas the loſſes of his Adverſaries would eaſily be repaired by freſh recruits, which he could not have, and therefore enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the name of the Land, and finding that the place intended him by the Oracle lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it, he re-embarqued his Soldiers, and with a proſperous Gale ſailed into <hi>Britain,</hi> arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at <hi>Totnes</hi> in the Province of <hi>Danmonia,</hi> and putting to flight the <hi>Albionians</hi> who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his landing.

The iſſue was, that after many bloody Battels both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were reduced to ſuch a paucity, that <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>'s Oracle, when conſulted by <hi>Brutus</hi> about the event of his Voyage, is ſaid to have termed this a <hi>Deſart Iſland,</hi> ſuch animoſity and hatred was between theſe two people, though there was room enough and to ſpare for both. The <hi>Samotheans</hi> having heard of <hi>Brutus</hi> his ſame, preſently repaired to him, and received him for their King, who to make good the opinion his new Subjects had conceived of him, ſought out the <hi>Albionians,</hi> and utterly defeated them, and then gave <hi>Danmonia</hi> to <hi>Chorinaeus,</hi> from whom the Weſtern part of it was called <hi>Cori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> now <hi>Cornwall.</hi> But as they were ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing a Feſtival for joy of their Succeſſes, not ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting any danger, on a ſudden they were
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49786:33"/>ſet upon, and many killed by thirty of the boldeſt <hi>Albionians,</hi> who ſince their overthrow had lurked in Caves thereabouts. <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Chorinaeus</hi> with their company betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their weapons, and ſurrounding theſe Deſperadoes ſlue them all but their Chief, whoſe name was <hi>Gormagot,</hi> and is reported to have been a Giant of a prodigious height, whoſe ſtrength <hi>Chorinaeus</hi> deſired to try in wreſtling, which he afterwards did by the Sea-ſide; in which conteſt he was ſo enraged with the pain of his three Ribs which had broke in the ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that heaving him up by main ſtrength he caſt him violently down a ſteep Rock into the Sea where he periſhed. After which to prevent ſuch ſurpriſes for the future, they by degrees extirpated his whole Crue; and this was the end of the <hi>Albionians,</hi> ſo named from their Founder <hi>Albion,</hi> who are ſaid to have been a Generation of Giants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brutus</hi> thus ſettled in his new Kingdom, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that all his Subjects both <hi>Samotheans</hi> and <hi>Trojans</hi> ſhould be called <hi>Britans,</hi> and then upon the ſide of the River <hi>Thames</hi> he built the City <hi>Trinobant</hi> (which the <hi>Welſh</hi> will have to be more rightly named <hi>Troynovant</hi>) for a place of Reſidence for himſelf and his Succeſſors: dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, after a happy Reign of four and twenty years, he left his Kingdom to be divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his three Sons, but reſerved the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority and Soveraignty to the Eldeſt which was <hi>Locrinus,</hi> whoſe part was better than both his Brothers, and was of him named <hi>Loegria,</hi> as <hi>Camber</hi>'s part was named <hi>Cambria,</hi> and <hi>Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nactus</hi>

Three Ladies were taken Priſoners by <hi>Humber</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> whom he brought with him into <hi>Britain,</hi> one of which called <hi>Eſtrildis</hi> was a King's Daughter. <hi>Locrinus</hi> intended her for his wife, and therefore carried them all three with him to Court.

As the Youth were exerciſing themſelves at Martial ſports, it chanced that two young Noblemen fell out; the one, named <hi>Hireldas,</hi> is by <hi>Geffrey</hi> of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> ſaid to be Nophew to <hi>Caſwallan;</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, named <hi>Evelinus,</hi> to <hi>Mandubratius: Henry</hi> of <hi>Huntington</hi> ſaith they were their Sons.

The next day <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſent out three parties to purſue the <hi>Britans,</hi> of whom the hindmoſt were yet in ſight, when intelligence was brought by Horſe purpoſely ſent from <hi>Q. Atrius,</hi> that his Navy was terribly Wrackt by a Tempeſt the night before, many of his Ships being utterly ſpoiled, and almoſt all of them ſhrewdly ſhattered. Hereupon he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calls thoſe Soldiers, and himſelf in perſon ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens to the Sea-ſide. There he ſets all his Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrights to work, ſends for more to <hi>Labienus,</hi> who
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49786:42"/>in his abſence commanded in chief in <hi>Gaul,</hi> with orders to build more Ships, and with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible pains of his Legionaries who laboured day and night, brought it to this effect, that all but forty Ships were made ſerviceable, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing haled up to land, were incloſed within one and the ſame Fortification with the Camp; and ſo leaving to their defence the ſame ſtrength as before, he returns to the place from whence he came. There he found ready for him a greater Army of <hi>Britans</hi> than any that had yet come againſt him; for upon the news of his ſecond arrival with ſo great Forces, they found a neceſſity for a ſpeedy compoſure of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine diſſenſions. And though <hi>Caſwallan</hi> had at other times alſo, during his Fathers life, been at war with divers States that bordered upon him; yet in this exigence, both in regard of his power, and his ability, in Martial Affairs, they all judged him the fitteſt perſon for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of this War, and in a publick Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil elected him their Captain-General. He therefore with his Cavalry and Charioteers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains <hi>Caeſar</hi> with a ſharp conflict, but finding his naked <hi>Britans</hi> unable to maintain the fight long againſt the well-armed Veterans, retreats to the Woods, ſtill turning upon the Purſuers, and cutting many off; and obſerving his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, when <hi>Caeſar</hi> thought there had been an end of fighting for that day, and was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying his men about entrenching, ſuddenly iſſued out upon thoſe that kept ward before the Camp, and was in a fair way to have put them to the ſword, if two Cohorts had not been
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49786:42"/>ſpeedily ſent to their reſcue, who joyning with them, were with other freſh ſupplies gotten behind the <hi>Britans.</hi> But ſuch an impreſſion of terror was upon them, that <hi>Caſwallan</hi> found it no very difficult matter to charge through the midſt of them, and carry off his men with ſafety. In this fight <hi>Nennius</hi> received his mortal wound, having firſt ſlain a Tribune, named <hi>Laberius,</hi> whom <hi>Oroſius Beda,</hi> and <hi>Monumethenſis</hi> through miſtake call <hi>Labienus.</hi> The next morning the <hi>Britans</hi> ſhewed themſelves here and there in ſmall companies upon the Hills, and had ſome ſlight skirmiſhes with their Enemies; but at Noon they fell furiouſly upon <hi>C. Trebonius,</hi> who was ſent out a forraging with three Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, and all the Horſe; theſe they charged even to the very Legions and their Standards, but were as ſtoutly received by the <hi>Romans,</hi> who repulſed them, and preſſed ſo hard upon them, that they put them by from their former way of fighting; and giving them no time either to rally, or ſtand, or deſcend from their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots, gained a compleat victory, with much ſlaughter of the Aſſailants in the Battel and purſuit. After this the <hi>Britans</hi> never encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the <hi>Romans</hi> with their main power, for the greater part of them departed to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Provinces. <hi>Caeſar</hi> then marched to the River <hi>Thames,</hi> which he was informed was no where paſſable but in one place. To impede his paſſage, under the water were ſtuck many ſharp Stakes unſeen, and others upon the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bank, where good Forces ſtood embattel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to ſet upon them in that diſorder, which
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49786:43"/>they reaſonably hoped this Device might put them in. The place retains the name of <hi>Coway Stakes,</hi> near <hi>Oatlands</hi> ſtill. <hi>Nennius</hi> aſcribes this to <hi>Dolobellus,</hi> chief Commander now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Caſwallan,</hi> as he had been under his Father before. But all was ſpoiled by Traiterous Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitives, and diſcovered to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who ſending over a party of Horſe firſt, ordered his Foot to follow, which they reſolutely performed, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up to the neck with ſuch ſpeed and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and fell on ſo boldly, that they ſoon put the amazed <hi>Britans</hi> to ſlight, whom <hi>Polyaenus</hi> falſly reports to have been frightned at the ſight of an Elephant, with a Turret upon his back. <hi>Caſwallan</hi> now deſpairing of ſucceſs by open force, reſolves to try if he can weary out his Enemy; and therefore retaining with him only four thouſand Charioteers, he attends the motions of the <hi>Romans.</hi> By the advantage he had in the knowledge of the Countrey he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himſelf from being forced to fight, and as often as their Horſemen went forth, and ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out in the fields for Forrage or Booty, he ſent out his Chariots upon them from the Woods, who ſlaughtering ſome, and terrifying others, made them afraid to range abroad, and <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf was induced to give ſtrict com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that none ſhould part from the Legions, who in all their march had nothing left them in their way but empty Fields and Houſes, which they ſpoil'd and burnt, the Cattel being before driven away by the <hi>Britans.</hi> In the mean time the <hi>Trinobantes</hi> ſubmit to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting him to ſend their Prince <hi>Mandubratius</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:49786:43"/>to them, and to protect him againſt <hi>Caſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi>'s violence. Of them <hi>Caeſar</hi> required and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived forty Hoſtages, and Corn for his Army, and therewith ſent <hi>Mandubratius</hi> to them. The <hi>Cenimagni, Segontiaci, Ancalites, Bibroci,</hi> and <hi>Caſſij,</hi> follow their example, and yield to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who learns by the laſt that <hi>Caſwallan</hi>'s chief Town (ſuppoſed to be <hi>Vernlam</hi>) was not far off. Thither he ſpeeds, and aſſaults it in two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places, the <hi>Britans</hi> ſoon quitting it, of whom many were taken in their flight, and put to the ſword. In <hi>Kent, Cyngetorix, Carrili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Taximagulus,</hi> and <hi>Segonax,</hi> by <hi>Caſwallan</hi>'s orders, aſſail the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, but were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed by thoſe that were left to guard it, who in a Sally did good execution upon them, and took <hi>Cyngetorix</hi> Priſoner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſwallan</hi> after ſo many loſſes finding himſelf baſely deſerted by the other States, by means of <hi>Comius</hi> of <hi>Artois,</hi> ſought and obtained at <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>'s hands a Peace upon theſe termes, That he ſhould pay a certain Tribute yearly, and no wayes moleſt <hi>Mandubratius,</hi> or the <hi>Trinobantes,</hi> and that Hoſtages ſhould be given for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, which was accordingly done. And thus the Victor having ſpent almoſt all the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer here, with a great number of Captives re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns into <hi>Gaul,</hi> being forced to tranſport his Army at two ſeveral paſſages, by reaſon of the loſs of Ships, which the forementioned Storm had cauſed. After this <hi>Caſwallan</hi> (whom <hi>Caeſar</hi> calls <hi>Caſſivellaunus</hi>) reigned ſeven years, and dyed in peace, having reigned in all nineteen years, eleven with his Father, (as likewiſe did
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49786:44"/>
               <hi>Lhud</hi>) and eight after his death. <hi>Mandubratius</hi> is by <hi>Beda</hi> called <hi>Androgorius;</hi> by <hi>Oroſius</hi> and <hi>Monumethenſis, Andregeus;</hi> and is in the Book of <hi>Triads</hi> reckoned the firſt of the Three moſt infamous perſons that <hi>Britain</hi> ever bred, as who was not content to have recovered his own, but alſo procured by his inſinuating ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations the ſubmiſſion of thoſe other Cities, which ruined all the brave endeavours of his Heroick Uncle for his Countreys liberty, who (as <hi>Caeſar</hi> tells us) was <hi>Maximè permotus defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctione Civitatum,</hi> Moſt of all troubled with the Revolt of the States. The <hi>Monmouth</hi> Writer makes this <hi>Androgeus</hi> (in ſtead of <hi>Comius</hi>) the procurer of his Uncles peace, and the valiant <hi>Scaeva</hi> to be his Son, and one of the thirty Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtages (abating ten of the true number,) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Traitor <hi>Bericus</hi> (of whom anon) had been a ſitter Son for ſuch a Father, and <hi>Scaeva.</hi> by better Authors appears to be a <hi>Roman,</hi> and to have been in <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Service before the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of thoſe Hoſtages: Then he tells us, that <hi>Androgeus</hi> forſook his Principality, and went with <hi>Caeſar</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> which is evinced to be falſe by the injunction laid upon <hi>Caſwallan</hi> not to meddle with him. His Brother <hi>Tenevan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> was of a more publick ſpirit, and would not ſeek to revenge the wrongs done to his Family by the enſlaving of his Countrey, but joyned with his Uncle againſt the common Enemy, whereby he ſo won upon him, that dying iſſueleſs he left him his Kingdom, which was enlarged by the acceſſion of the Province of the <hi>Trinobantes.</hi> upon the death of <hi>Mandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bratius,</hi>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:49786:44"/>who alſo had no Children. This King withheld the Tribute, whereupon <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twenty years after <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi>'s laſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion, reſolved upon an Expedition hither, rather than put up ſuch a contempt from a Countrey of little note in thoſe dayes; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come into <hi>Ganl,</hi> he there heard news of the Revolt of the <hi>Pannonians,</hi> which diverted him for that time. Seven years after he was coming again, but finding <hi>Gaul</hi> in an unſettled condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he accepted the offers of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, who promiſed Obedience and Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for the Tribute detained. But upon fail of payment he the next year prepared for a third Expedition; which to prevent, the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> again ſend Ambaſſadors to him, who coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> offered Gifts in the <hi>Capitol,</hi> and ſacrificed to the <hi>Roman</hi> Gods, ſwore him Fealty in the Temple of <hi>Mars,</hi> agreeing to pay Tolls and Cuſtoms for all Wares which they tranſported into other parts, and paid him their Tribute. By this obſequious addreſs <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was pacified, not being over-ambitious to catch at all opportunities of enlarging his Empire, which he thought was already great enough, as likewiſe did his Succeſſor <hi>Tiberius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To <hi>Tenevantius,</hi> after twenty three years Reign, ſucceded his Son <hi>Cunoheline.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> was entertained with troubles at his very entrance upon his Charge, for they that had leagued with the <hi>Romans,</hi> or ſubmitted to them, were over-run by the other <hi>Britans,</hi> who encouraged themſelves with a conceit of the new Propraetor's unacquaintedneſs with the Army. But he knowing firſt Succeſſes to be of great conſequence, with his readieſt Cohorts advanced againſt them, whom he ſoon routed and diſperſed, and then fell to diſarming them that he ſuſpected, and by placing Garriſons and Forts upon the Rivers <hi>Antona</hi> and <hi>Sabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> attempted to hemme in ſo much of the Iſland as he was concerned to defend. <hi>Sabrina</hi> is granted by all to be <hi>Severn,</hi> but <hi>Antona</hi> is not ſo well known, <hi>Camden</hi> ſaith it is the River <hi>Nen</hi> that runs by <hi>Northampton,</hi> but then he will have it to be tranſcribed amiſs for <hi>Aufona,</hi> upon a ſuppoſition that the <hi>Britans</hi> called all Rivers <hi>Avon,</hi> and ſo <hi>Northampton</hi> ſhould be contracted of <hi>Northafandon.</hi> But I cannnot ſee any neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of blaming the Tranſcriber here, nor any reaſon why <hi>Northampton</hi> or <hi>Northanton</hi> may not take its name from <hi>Antona,</hi> ſince himſelf allows <hi>Southampton</hi> to be ſo called from a River of the very ſame name. The <hi>Icenians,</hi> who had ſought the friendſhip of <hi>Plautius,</hi> diſliked the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49786:47"/>proceedings of <hi>Oſtorius,</hi> and armed againſt him, with their Confederates, but were overcome, whereby they that wavered were confirmed in their obedience. In this conflict <hi>M. Oſtorius,</hi> the Licutenant's Son, merited a Civick Crown or Garland. The <hi>Cangi</hi> were the next who felt the anger of the <hi>Romans,</hi> by whom their Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory was waſted and harryed all over. The Lieutenant was gotten near the Sea-coaſt which looks towards <hi>Ireland,</hi> when ſome ſtirs among the <hi>Brigantes</hi> brought him back; but thoſe he quickly quieted by ſeizing and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome great ones, who would have incited that people againſt him, the reſt upon his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to remit the Commotion departing peaceably to their homes.</p>
            <p>But a War with the <hi>Silures</hi> could not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided; King <hi>Caradock</hi> in perſon headed them, who could not be prevailed with by all the Lieutenant's endeavours to have any peace with the <hi>Romans.</hi> Againſt him therefore <hi>Oſtorius</hi> bends all his Force, having given ſome Cities to a <hi>Britiſh</hi> King named <hi>Cogidunus,</hi> to engage him againſt thoſe that ſhould raiſe any diſturbances while he was dealing with the <hi>Silures. Caradock</hi> conſidering how <hi>Siluria</hi> was hemm'd in between the <hi>Severn</hi> and the Sea, marched into the countrey of the <hi>Ordovices,</hi> who were confederated with him, where all the odds were to his own party; all the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to his Enemies. <hi>Oſtorius</hi> follows, and near <hi>Clun</hi>-caſtle in <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> forced him to a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, wherein though he and his <hi>Britans</hi> fought ſtoutly, yet the fortune of <hi>Rome</hi> prevailed.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49786:48"/>Here his Wife and Daughter were taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, and ſome Brothers of his yielded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; himſelf eſcaping to <hi>Cartiſinandua,</hi> Queen of the <hi>Brigantes,</hi> was by her command unworthily bound with Irons, and delivered to his Enemies,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="51"/> in the ninth year of the war, and the ſeventh year of his Reign.

Thus having been carried round about <hi>Britain,</hi> and loſt their Galleys for want of Pilots, they were ſeized by the <hi>Suevians</hi> and <hi>Friſians</hi> for Pirats and Rovers, and being ſold for Slaves fom Maſter to Maſter, ſome of them happened into the hands of <hi>Romans,</hi> among whom they grew into a Name by relating their ſo ſtrange Adventure. <hi>Agricola</hi> increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Army with the addition of many <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> more faithful to him than to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, marches up further into <hi>Caledonia,</hi> and on the declining of the Hill <hi>Grampius</hi> (now <hi>Grantzbain</hi>) finds his Enemies lodged to the number of thirty thouſand, to whom the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious Youth, and even the Old men that were yet vigorous, and had gained Renown in former Services, daily flocked. <hi>Galgacus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Liennacus,</hi> Prince of the <hi>Caledonians,</hi> reckoned in the Book of <hi>Triads</hi> for the ſecond of the three Illuſtrious <hi>Britiſh</hi> Heroes, was Commander in chief. <hi>Agricola</hi> having ſent his Fleet before to diſtract the <hi>Britans</hi> by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and uncertain Landings, and to do them what other miſchief they could, charged vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly upon them, and was received with equal courage, whilſt the one ſide fought for life and liberty, the other for honour and conqueſt. The
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49786:53"/>manner of the Fight is excellently deſcribed by <hi>Tacitus;</hi> the ſucceſs in ſhort was this, That the <hi>Britans</hi> after a ſtout reſiſtance were van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed with the loſs often thouſand men, and on the <hi>Roman</hi> part were ſlain three hundred and forty, and among them <hi>Aulus Atticus</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of a Cohort.

The Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer was almoſt at an end, and therefore the Lieutenant brings his victorious Army into the borders of the <hi>Horreſtians,</hi> (ſo called for <hi>Horeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kians,</hi> or <hi>Areskians,</hi> becauſe dwelling upon the River <hi>Eske,</hi>) and receives of them Hoſtages, and commands the Admiral of his Navy to ſail about <hi>Britain,</hi> by whom it was firſt found to be an Iſland, and the Iſles of <hi>Orkney</hi> diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and ſudued. Himſelf with ſlow Marches to awe the new conquered Nations with the very ſtay of his Paſſage, diſpoſes his Army into Winter-quarters, and the Fleet having finiſhed their Voyage, return to the Port, which in <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi> is, through frequent Tranſcriptions, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly written <hi>Trutulenſis,</hi> as <hi>Beatus Rhenanus</hi> ſaith, for <hi>Rhutupenſis.</hi> As <hi>Agricola</hi> was one of the beſt Generals of his time in the world, ſo was he alſo a Prudent and Politick Governour; firſt, he reformed his own Family, not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Attendants or Followers to ſway or meddle in Publick Affairs; then the Army, by electing Officers, not for Bribes or Affection, but for Virtue and Merit; next he took care for the obſerving of Equity, and corrected all
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:49786:54"/>thoſe petty Abuſes in the collecting of Tributes, and Exactions, which are uſually more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous than the Burden it ſelf; the people rude and ſcattered, and therefore prone upon every occaſion to War, he ſo perſwaded, as to build Temples, Houſes, and places of publick reſort, the principal men's children he cauſed to be edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in the way of Learning; and by commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the wits of the <hi>Britans</hi> above the <hi>Gauls,</hi> made them affect the comptneſs of the <hi>Roman</hi> Language; then he brought them to imitate the <hi>Roman</hi> faſhions for Attire, and ſo by little and little the incitements and materials of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xury, ſtately Edifices, Baths, and ſumptuous Banquets, grew to be in requeſt among them. By theſe means the Nation was ſoftned, and in a manner pleaſed with their Servitude.</p>
            <p>In all probability, if <hi>Agricola</hi> had continued in his Government,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="86"/> he had ſubdued the whole Iſland; but the Emperour <hi>Domitian</hi> envying his Glory recalled him, ſending in his place <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtius Lucullus,</hi> whom he afterwards put to death, becauſe having deviſed certain Spears or Lances of a new faſhion, he had called them after his own name, <hi>Luculleans.</hi> Soon after, as is collected from a Preface of <hi>Tacitus</hi> to the firſt of his Hiſtories, the <hi>Britans</hi> freed from the fear of <hi>Agricola,</hi> who was poyſoned with the Emperour's privity, again betook themſelves to Arms, at what time the Name of <hi>Arviragus</hi> was famous at <hi>Rome,</hi> as appears from <hi>Juvenal,</hi> who brings in <hi>Fabricius Veiento</hi> thus flattering <hi>Domitian.</hi>

They generally give him the Character of a Religious and Munificent Prince, and ſay, that he did very liberally give Poſſeſſions and Territories to Churches and Church-men, which he confirmed to them by Charters, and that he priviledged Churches and Churchyards to be Sanctuaries, and places of Refuge for ſuch Offenders as fled to them. He was the firſt <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropaean</hi> King that we read of, who received the Chriſtian Faith, and <hi>Britain</hi> the firſt Land in which it was by Publick Authority profeſſed. A high and ſingular Honour for our Country, and which (next to Divine Providence) is in a great meaſure to be aſcribed to the clemency of the Emperour <hi>Aurelius</hi> to the Chriſtians, upon his miraculous victory over the <hi>Germans.</hi> Some with a manifeſt Antichroniſme confound this King with <hi>Lucius</hi> the Apoſtle of the <hi>Rheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Bavarians;</hi> but <hi>Achilles Caſſarus,</hi> in his deſcription of <hi>Augſpurg,</hi> (as we have him in <hi>Munſter</hi>'s Coſmography,) and Archbiſhop <hi>

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:49786:63"/>that it was cuſtomary with the <hi>Romans</hi> to permit Kings to reign in ſeveral Countreys which they had ſubdued, as in <hi>Judaea Herod,</hi> in <hi>Cilicia Tarcondemus,</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia Archelaus,</hi> in <hi>Pontus Polemon,</hi> in <hi>Mauritania Juba,</hi> and here in <hi>Britain Cogidunus;</hi> and that even at this time the Emperour <hi>Lucius Verus</hi> having fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the <hi>Parthian</hi> War, did, as <hi>Julius Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolinus</hi> ſaith, diſtribute Kingdoms to Kings, and Provincial Governments to his Counts. I do not fondly ſuppoſe that he was King of all <hi>Britain,</hi> (as <hi>Geffrey</hi> would perſwade us) nor yet of the greater part of it; but I rather think, that after <hi>Arviragus</hi> was driven out of <hi>Siluria</hi> by <hi>Frontinus,</hi> and out of <hi>Ordovicia</hi> by <hi>Agricola,</hi> the Province of the <hi>Belgae,</hi> with part of the Province of the <hi>Dobuni,</hi> might upon his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion be granted to him, as places not ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to be reconquered, if he or his Succeſſors ſhould revolt, being an open Champaine Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, of eaſie acceſs, and ſurrounded in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with <hi>Roman</hi> Garriſons. That <hi>Arviragus, Marius, Coelus,</hi> and <hi>Lucius,</hi> bore ſome ſway in this part of the Iſland I am the rather inclined to believe, becauſe I read of their Sepulture at <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> and their Bounty to <hi>Glaſtonbury,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the laſt King's Liberality to <hi>Wincheſter</hi> and <hi>Congresbury,</hi> all which places ſtand within this Territory.

His Death is ſaid to have been accompanied with divers Miracles, and particularly <hi>Gildas</hi> tells us, That by his Prayers he made a way through the River for himſelf, and a thouſand others to paſs over dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed.

But a party of Soldiers were ſent to bring them and their Inſtructor back, who

            <p>In the Eaſt that renowned Soldier St. <hi>George</hi> was martyred about the beginning of this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution.

To confirm this Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to excuſe the deaths of <hi>Didymius</hi> and <hi>Verenianus, Conſtantine</hi> diſpatches another Ambaſſador, named <hi>Jovius,</hi> who told the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, that they were ſlain by the Soldiers, without the privity of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and againſt his will. But finding <hi>Honorius</hi> highly incenſed at it, he adviſed him, that conſidering the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent poſture of Aſſairs, he ſhould remit his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger againſt <hi>Conſtantine</hi> for what was paſt reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, promiſing that if he would give him leave to repair to his Maſter, and inform him of the ſtate of <hi>Italy,</hi> he would return to his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with the Forces of <hi>Gaul, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Britain;</hi> and upon this aſſurance he was ſafely diſiniſt.

In <hi>Gaul, Conſtantine,</hi> holding his condition now ſecure, becomes ſupine and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent, giving himſelf over to Gluttony and Belly-chear. His Son <hi>Conſtans</hi> he ſends back in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Spain,</hi> who taking with him one <hi>Juſtus</hi> to be General of his Army there, gave thereby ſuch offence to <hi>Gerontius,</hi> that he ſet up one of his friends named <hi>Maximus</hi> for Emperour at <hi>Tarracon,</hi> and excited the <hi>Vandals,</hi> and other Barbarous people in <hi>Gaul,</hi> to break their league with <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> who was too weak for them in this conjuncture, the greateſt part of his Forces being in <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſiding with his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. This advantage was eſpyed and taken by the Nations beyond the <hi>Rhine,</hi> who here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon cruelly afflicted ſeveral parts of <hi>Gaul</hi> with their incurſions, and the Maritime Cities of <hi>Britain</hi> with their Piracies. Which when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> could not redreſs, the <hi>Britans</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed themſelves to <hi>Honorius,</hi> and craved aid of him. But he having his hands full of the <hi>Gothick</hi> War, adviſes them to take courage, and defend themſelves, and by his Letter acquits them of their ſubjection to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</p>
            <p>They therefore thus diſcharged, took Arms, and defended themſelves as well as they could; whoſe example was quickly followed by the <hi>Britans</hi> of <hi>Armorica.</hi> At the ſame time the <hi>Franks</hi> croſſing the <hi>Rhine,</hi> took the Imperial City of <hi>Triers,</hi> and the <hi>Vandals, Sueves,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans</hi> paſſed over the <hi>Pirenaean</hi> Hills, and joyning with the Forces which <hi>Conſtans</hi> had left there in Garriſon, entred <hi>Spain.

And now he had leiſure to think of revenge againſt <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</hi> ſince his greateſt Enemy <hi>Alarick</hi> King of the <hi>Goths,</hi> was alſo lately dead at <hi>Conſentia.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Gerontius</hi> leaving <hi>Maximus</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> marches for <hi>Gaul;</hi> whereupon <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> orders his Son <hi>Conſtans</hi> to ſtay at <hi>Vienna,</hi> while he ſends <hi>Edobichus</hi> to the <hi>Franks</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> for aid. But <hi>Gerontius</hi> takes <hi>Vienna</hi> by Aſſault, and kills <hi>Conſtans,</hi> and from thence conducts his Forces againſt <hi>Conſtantine</hi> himſelf, and layes Siege to <hi>Arles.</hi> Thither comes <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius,</hi> General for the Emperour <hi>Honorius,</hi> and ſits down before the City too. At whoſe coming <hi>Gerontius</hi> finding that many of his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers deſerted him, and fearing a general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt in caſe of longer ſtay there, broke up his Leaguer, and haſted for <hi>Spain</hi> (with thoſe
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:49786:89"/>that would follow him,) in ſuch ſort as little differed from plain flight. The remainder of his Army went over to <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> who hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Edobichus</hi> was advancing againſt him, ſent his Lieutenant General <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lphilas,</hi> and part of his Army before, with orders to conceal themſelves in ſome convenient place, while their Enemy paſſed by; himſelf follows, march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing directly againſt <hi>Edobichus,</hi> between whom was fought a cruel Battel: but in the end <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bichus</hi> being charged by <hi>Conſtantius</hi> before, and by <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lphilas</hi> behind, was with great ſlaughter defeated, and in this diſtreſs flees to an ancient friend of his named <hi>Ecdicius,</hi> whom he had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ways obliged formerly. <hi>Ecdicius</hi> receives him with a feigned kindneſs, and in the night cuts off his head, which he preſents to <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> in hopes of being well rewarded for it. But when he would have ſtayed in the Camp, the worthy General commanded him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, as deteſting the ſight of him who had been perfidious to a deſerving friend. This ſucceſs ſo diſcouraged <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> that to ſave his life he turn'd Prieſt, when he had reigned four years; and ſo <hi>Arles,</hi> after a Siege of four months, was ſurrendred. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> being taken with his Son <hi>Julian,</hi> whom he had named <hi>Nobiliſſimus,</hi> was ſent into <hi>Italy,</hi> and near the River <hi>Mincius</hi> beheaded by the order of <hi>Honorius,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="411"/> in the year four hundred and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Jovinus,</hi> who commanded in <hi>Gaul</hi> under <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> drawing together all the Forces of that Countrey, with ſtrong ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies

            <p>In <hi>Spain, Gerontius,</hi> after his ſhameful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, grew into ſuch contempt with the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that they beſet his houſe in the night, where, with the help of his friend <hi>Alanus</hi> and a few Servants, he defended himſelf ſtoutly, and ſlew above three hundred of them, and when his Darts and other weapons were ſpent, he might at laſt have eſcaped at a private door as his Servants did; but not enduring to leave his wife <hi>Nonnichia,</hi> whom he entirely loved, to the violence of enraged Mutineers, he firſt cut off the head of his dear friend <hi>Alanus,</hi> then of his own Wife <hi>Nonnichia,</hi> at the earneſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty of them both, who loved him ſo affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionately, that they would not ſurvive him. Laſt of all, he turns his ſword againſt himſelf, but miſſing the mortal place finiſhes his work with his Poniard, more fortunate in his friend than <hi>Edobichus,</hi> though leſs deſerving it for his Diſloyalty.</p>
            <p>Of the death of this <hi>Gerontius,</hi> Mr. <hi>Humfrey Lhoyd</hi> ſaith in his brief Commentaries, there were extant in his time very ancient <hi>Britiſh</hi> Rhymes, if he miſtake him not for another <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rontius</hi> that was Prince of <hi>Danmonia,</hi> many years after this man's time.</p>
            <p>Upon the ſurrendry of <hi>Arles, Conſtantius</hi> goes againſt <hi>Jovinus,</hi> whom he overcomes and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:49786:90"/>drives out of the countrey. In his room up ſtarts his Brother <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> whom <hi>Conſtantius</hi> ſoon defeated and ſlew, together with his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices, Saluſtius</hi> and <hi>Ruſticus.</hi> Next he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts his Forces into <hi>Spain</hi> againſt <hi>Maximus,</hi> whom with like ſucceſs he vanquiſhes and takes Priſoner; but after a ſhort time diſmiſſes him, as one who had not aſpired to that uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation through his own ambition, but was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made a Stale to the Politick ends of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancers.</p>
            <p>Thoſe <hi>Britans</hi> that came over with <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> when the War was ended, never went home, but joyned themſelves with their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in <hi>Armorica:</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Britans</hi> thus overpower'd and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſend Ambaſſadors to the Emperour <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius,</hi> and humbly beſeech him, with pittious prayers and promiſes of perpetual Subjection and Loyal Obedience for the future, to ſuccour them in this their diſtreſs: whereupon in the year four hundred twenty two,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="422"/> a Legion ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provided for the War was by <hi>Aetius,</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Forces in <hi>Gaul,</hi> diſpatched hither, who encountring with the Enemies, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a huge number of them, drove them out of the Province, and by ſo bloody a victory de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered their Friends and Subjects from immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent peril. Then they ordered them to build acroſs the Iſland, between the aforeſaid Friths of <hi>Edenborough</hi> and <hi>Dunbritton,</hi> from <hi>Abercorne</hi> to <hi>Kirk Patrick,</hi> as <hi>Lollius</hi> and <hi>Cerauſius</hi> had done before, a Wall, which being made with Garriſons of Soldiers, might be a terror to their Foes, and a ſafeguard to themſelves. But the <hi>Romans</hi> being recalled to be employed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt other Enemies, could not ſtay to ſee the work done; ſo that it being made without fit Directors by the common people and unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Rout, not ſo much of Stone as of Turſ, proved to little purpoſe.</p>
            <p>This year the two forementioned Uſurpers, <hi>Maximus</hi> and <hi>Jovinus,</hi> going about to raiſe new Stirs with the aſſiſtance of the Barbarous Nations, were taken in <hi>Spain</hi> by <hi>Caſtinus</hi> and <hi>Boniface,</hi> who ſent them into <hi>Italy,</hi> where
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:49786:91"/>they ſerved to adorn the Trinmph of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Honorius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About this time flouriſhed two famous <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Biſhops, <hi>Faſtidius,</hi> and <hi>Ninianus,</hi> of whom the former wrote to one <hi>Fatalis</hi> a worthy Book, concerning <hi>Chriſtian Life,</hi> (as ſome Copies of <hi>Gennadius</hi> have it, or as others, concerning <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi>) and another, of <hi>continuing in the ſtate of Widowhood;</hi> the other converted the Southern <hi>Picts,</hi> inhabiting between <hi>Forth</hi> and <hi>Grantzbain,</hi> and was the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Candida Caſa,</hi> (now <hi>Whitleerne</hi> in <hi>Galloway,</hi>) where he built a Church of Stone, which, as <hi>Joannes Tinmuthenſis</hi> ſaith, was the firſt Church of Stone in <hi>Britain;</hi> and in <hi>Ireland</hi> he founded a large Monaſtery at a place called <hi>Cluayn Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> both he and his Brother <hi>Plebeias</hi> were Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonized for Saints.</p>
            <p>In the year four hundred twenty five,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="425"/> the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> knowing that the <hi>Romans</hi> were returned home, again invaded the <hi>Britans,</hi> breaking down the Rampire, and all other Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, committing all ſorts of cruelty, and ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out their Piratick Veſſels robbed and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſackt their Coaſts in a miſerable manner. The <hi>Britans</hi> therefore again ſend ſuppliant Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to entreat the <hi>Romans,</hi> in meer commiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their caſe, and for their own Honour, once more to relieve them. Whereupon <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> by the Emperour <hi>Valentinian</hi>'s command,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="426"/> in the year four hundred twenty ſix, ſends o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver another Legion under the conduct of <hi>Gallio</hi> of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> wo forthwith marched againſt thoſe ſpoiling Enemies, and giving them a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

            <p>After this Exploit the <hi>Romans</hi> declare to the <hi>Britans,</hi> That the preſent condition of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire would not permit them to take any more ſuch troubleſome Journeys, and therefore they muſt reſolve to defend themſelves, and not be afraid of Nations no wayes more valiant than they, if by ſloth and idleneſs they did not weaken themſelves. So giving Manful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations to a Fearful People, and teaching them to make and handle Arms, they together with the Inhabitants, at the common charge of all, and with the private additional helps of many, built a Wall of Stone from Sea to Sea, in the ſame place, where, as <hi>Bede</hi> and others ſay,<note place="margin">Bed. lib. <hi>5.</hi> cap. <hi>12.</hi>

There was placed along this Wall, upon an high Fort, a Garriſon, conſiſting of ſuch as lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both Military skill and courage, who ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and watching there day and night, became lazy with doing nothing.

The decay of the State had wrought a ſtrange decay of Religion, the greateſt part of this Army was yet unbaptized; they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore firſt liſt them under Chriſt's Banner by

Nor were the Provincials only thus exhauſted, but ſometimes too the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern <hi>Britans</hi> were drawn into the <hi>Roman</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.

            </p>
            <p>It appears then, that the loſs of this Iſland was a great damage to the <hi>Romans,</hi> who bore ſway here above four hundred and ſixty years, from <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi>'s Conqueſt to the laſt <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</hi> and ſo highly eſteemed, that they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it the <hi>Roman Iſle,</hi> and <hi>Romania,</hi> and the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Language was grown ſo familiar among them, that <hi>Gildas</hi> calls the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue his <hi>own Language.</hi> In all which time the <hi>Britans</hi> had Kings of their own, reigning in ſome part of the Land, which no other <hi>European</hi> Province of the Empire had. And this may be further ſaid for the credit of our <hi>Britans,</hi> That when the Barbarous Nations like an inundation broke into the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, all the other Provinces never endeavoured to aſſert, in the way of war or oppoſition, either their ancient repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or their Native Liberties, but ſuffered themſelves to be won, loſt, fought for, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain recovered by their quarrelſome Maſters, as if they had no Title to their own Countrey, but were born to follow the fortunes of all Pretenders: only this people ſtood up for themſelves, and when ſtored with a new ſtock of vigorous Youth, conteſted bravely, not only with the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> but with the <hi>Saxons</hi> too, though much more potent Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. But at this time, as I ſaid, the <hi>Britans</hi> were in a very low condition, which <hi>William</hi>

               <note place="margin">Lib. <hi>1.</hi> de Reg.</note> having ſpoken of <hi>Maximus</hi> and <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> thus deſcribes. <hi>When the Tyrants had left none in the Countrey but half Barbarians, none in the Cities and Towns but ſuch as wholly gave themſeves to Belly-cheer,</hi> Britain <hi>deſtitute of all Protection by her vigorous young men, bereaved of all exerciſe and practice of good Arts, became ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for a long time to the greedy and gaping jaws of the hordering Nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aetius</hi> was at this time Captain General of the Forces of the Empire, and Conſul the third time with <hi>Symmachus,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="446"/> in the year four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred forty ſix, to whom the Diſtreſſed <hi>Britans</hi> ſend their Ambaſſadors with a pitious mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Letter, ſuperſcribed, <hi>To</hi> Aetius <hi>thrice Conſul, the Groans of the</hi> Britans: and after a few words, thus: <q>The Barbarians drive us to the Sea, the Sea puts us back to the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians, between theſe two ſorts of Death we either have our Throats cut, or are drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</q> The Brave <hi>Roman</hi> affords them pity, but can ſpare no Succours, not daring to diminiſh his Forces, becauſe <hi>Attila</hi> the <hi>Hunne,</hi> that Scourge and Terrour of the World, then threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Empire with a terrible Invaſion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Britans</hi> therefore thus diſappointed of their laſt hopes, oppreſſed with War and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, were many of them fain to yield them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Slaves to the raging Foes, meerly to get ſome food, were it never ſo little, to comfort and refreſh their poor hungry Souls. But there were ſome Nobler Spirits left, who betaking themſelves to the Mountains, Grots, and deſert woody Forreſts, made from thence a worthy
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:49786:96"/>reſiſtance. Some fortunate Succeſſes brought them more companions, ſo that having their numbers pretty well increaſed, with ſuch as meer Deſpair made valiant, they adventured to ſight their Enemies in plain field, and giving them ſundry overthrows chaſed them out of the Countrey.</p>
            <p>Having thus happily disburthened the Land of thoſe Spoilers, they enter into conſultation about preſerving it for the future; and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it would not be long before their Enemies returned again, they reſolved to chooſe among themſelves one ſupreme King for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement of their ſucceeding Affairs both mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and civil, to whom all the other Roytelets ſhould be ſubordinate. Hereupon they elect <hi>Vortigern</hi> (Prince of <hi>Ewias,</hi>) not the beſt but the greateſt man among them, one whoſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were in ſome ſort compenſated by the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of his Sons, who in all probability were the chief Inſtruments of their ſo late Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. By this ſurceaſe of Hoſtility the deſolate peoples ſore of Famine was perfectly healed, and in the ſtead of it there enſued in the year four hundred forty ſeven ſuch a fertility,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="447"/> and abundant plenty, as had never been remembred in any age before, which was abuſed to all kinds of riot and luxury, which was attended with exorbitant licentiouſneſs, and all manner of vice, not only among the Latty, but among many of the Clergy too. And to fill up the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of their Guilt, <hi>Pelagianiſme</hi> enters upon the Stage again; to repell which, thoſe of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Clergy, who retained their integrity
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:49786:97"/>and care of the Church, once more implored Biſhop <hi>German</hi>'s help, who (though <hi>Lupus</hi> was yet alive, and lived long after,) taking with him <hi>Severus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Triers,</hi> a man eminent for his piety,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="448"/> who had been <hi>Lupus</hi> his Diſciple, came over hither in the year for hundred forty eight, and aſſembling a Council in <hi>Siluria,</hi> there confuted the Heretical Teachers, who were ſtraight adjudged to Baniſhment, and delivered up into the hands of <hi>German.</hi> In the next place he ſharply reproved <hi>Vortigern</hi> for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous marriage with his own Daughter, by whom he had a Son named <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> whom the impudent Mother her ſelf was not aſhamed to preſent to the grave Biſhop, in the face of the whole Convention. <hi>Vortigerne</hi> taking of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence at the Biſhop's plain dealing with him, left the Council in a rage, having let flee ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous ſpeeches againſt that holy man; but his Eldeſt Son <hi>Vortimer,</hi> a Prince of another tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ſtayed behind, and gave the Land for ever to <hi>German,</hi> wherein he had ſuffered ſo reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful an abuſe; whereupon that part of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey was named <hi>Guarthenion,</hi> which in <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſignifies, <hi>A Slander juſtly retorted:</hi> and retorted it was, for here was the Tyrant for his Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities Excommunicated. The place is now called <hi>Gurthrenion,</hi> in <hi>Radnorſhire.</hi> In this Council it is ſaid, that the Son of one <hi>Elaphius,</hi> who was ſeized with a ſtrange lameneſs in the very flower of his youth, was miraculouſly cured and reſtored to the uſe of his limbs by <hi>German;</hi> who taking with him the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned <hi>Pelagian</hi> Sticklers returned into <hi>Gaul,</hi> and
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:49786:97"/>there diſpoſed of them in ſuch place where they could not infect others, and were themſelves under cure of better inſtruction. At his return the <hi>Armorican Britans</hi> made an addreſs to him upon this occaſion. The <hi>Britans,</hi> as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, were ſettled in <hi>Armorica,</hi> whereof they poſſeſſed the greater part, the reſt lying to the River <hi>Loire,</hi> being ſtill held by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and a little before this time governed by one <hi>Exupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantius:</hi> at firſt they lived under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Empire, though <hi>Conan Meriadoc,</hi> and his Son <hi>Grallon,</hi> did by permiſſion carry ſome ſhew of Authority among them. But in the laſt <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s time, they, as I ſaid before, caſt off all ſubjection to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Conan</hi>'s Grandſon, governed them as an abſolute King. <hi>Aetius,</hi> deſirous to reduce them, employes <hi>Eucharicus</hi> King of the <hi>Almans</hi> againſt them, whereupon they requeſt <hi>German</hi> to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate for them, and procure a peace; which he undertakes, and treats with <hi>Eucharicus,</hi> who refers the matter to <hi>Aetius,</hi> and <hi>Aetius</hi> to the Emperour <hi>Valentinian,</hi> then reſiding at <hi>Raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</hi> The good Biſhop, though very aged, takes a journey thither, where he is honourably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Emperour and his Mother <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidia,</hi> and had certainly prevailed in his ſuit, if the <hi>Armoricans</hi> had not upon ſome occaſion or advantage raiſed new ſtirs, and thereby made the difference wider. Here <hi>German</hi> dies, and his body being embalmed, was with a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Attendance carried back into <hi>Gaul,</hi> and with great ſolemnity enterred at <hi>Auxerre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time the <hi>Britans</hi> here proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:49786:98"/>in their courſes of Impiety, are allarmed with a dreadful report of their old Enemies coming on afreſh with full purpoſe to ſeize and poſſeſs the whole Iſland from one end to the other. And to add to the terrour, at the ſame time the Peſtilence breaks out ſo violently, and deſtroys ſuch multitudes, that there were ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough living left to bury the dead. All this while King <hi>Vortigern</hi> (whom <hi>Blandus</hi> calls <hi>Vertigerius; Paulus Diaconus, Vertegernus, Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponius Laetus,</hi> and <hi>Stephanus Pighius, Vertigoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus;</hi> and <hi>Wernerus Laerius, Vortigonus,</hi>) lay buried in voluptuouſneſs and ſenſuality, till at length excited by the peoples clamours, he ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons a Council, by whoſe advice this <hi>Proud unlucky Tyrant</hi> (as <hi>Gildas</hi> terms him) reſolves upon a deſperate Remedy for a deſperate Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; and decrees, That the <hi>Engliſh Saxons</hi> ſhall be invited to accept of Seats in ſome part of the Iſland, and to ſight for them; which made <hi>Gildas</hi> cry out: <hi>Oh the moſt palpable darkneſs of their Senſes! Oh deſperate and blockiſh dulneſs of their Minds! Thoſe whom in their abſence they dreaded more than Death it ſelf, were now freely and willingly invited to inhabit with them under the roof (as I may call it) of one ſelf ſame Houſe, by the fooliſh Princes of</hi> Taneos, <hi>giving indiſcreet counſel unto</hi> Pharaoh! Yet there are ſome, who look upon this Deſign as not ſo very unpolitick, however it proved unſucceſsful, ſince by this means at one time the Northern Enemies might be kept out, and the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Shores eaſed of the <hi>Saxons</hi> frequent depredations, and preſerved from the inroads of others of the ſame coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:49786:98"/>of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the ſame Piratick Trade.
